Overview

Version 6.0.6 introduces an improved Binary Market management experience with a redesigned creation wizard, and fixes reCAPTCHA integration for more reliable authentication.
Upgrade Notes
Step 1: Configure reCAPTCHA v3

Important: Before running the updator, you must ensure reCAPTCHA is configured correctly in your .env file. reCAPTCHA v2 is no longer supported - you must use v3.

    1Follow the complete setup guide: Authentication Setup
    2When creating your reCAPTCHA keys in Google Admin Console:

    Select reCAPTCHA v3 (NOT v2 - v2 will not work)
    Add your domains (e.g., yourdomain.com, www.yourdomain.com)
    Copy both Site Key and Secret Key

    1Update your .env file with the v3 keys:

env

   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY="your-v3-site-key"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY="your-v3-secret-key"

::alert{type="warning"} If you previously had reCAPTCHA v2 keys configured, you must generate new v3 keys. v2 keys will not work with this update. ::
Step 2: Run Updator
bash

pnpm updator

This will bundle your updated .env configuration into the production build.
