Overview

Version 6.0.4 introduces three major architectural improvements: a comprehensive Centralized Wallet Service, a Multi-Channel Notification Service, and Database-Backed Settings System. The wallet service consolidates all wallet operations across the platform, the notification service provides a unified solution for all platform communications, and the new settings system allows administrators to manage all platform configuration through the admin panel without server restarts. Additionally includes important bug fixes for KYC and binary trading.
Upgrade Notes
Step 1: Remove Deprecated Files

Run this command from your public_html directory to remove all deprecated files:
bash

rm .eslintignore \
  frontend/.eslintrc.json \
  "frontend/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/user/profile/components/profile-content.tsx" \
  "frontend/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/user/profile/components/profile-sidebar.tsx" \
  "frontend/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/user/profile/components/tabs/dashboard-tab.tsx" \
  "frontend/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/user/profile/components/tabs/personal-info-tab.tsx" \
  "frontend/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/user/profile/components/tabs/security-tab.tsx" \
  "frontend/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/user/profile/components/ui/activity-card.tsx" \
  "frontend/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/user/profile/components/ui/stat-card.tsx" \
  "frontend/app/[locale]/(dashboard)/user/profile/components/ui/tab-button.tsx" \
  "frontend/app/[locale]/(utility)/comming-soon/page.tsx" \
  "frontend/app/[locale]/(utility)/maintinance/page.tsx"

Step 2: Update Notification Templates

Run the following command to update notification templates with SMS and Push content:
bash

pnpm seed:notification

This will add SMS (160 char limit) and Push (240 char limit) message templates to all existing notification templates, enabling multi-channel notifications.
Step 3: Generate VAPID Keys for Web Push

Generate VAPID keys for browser push notifications:
bash

pnpm vapid:generate

This will prompt for your email and automatically update your .env file with the required VAPID keys.
Step 4: Run Updator
bash

pnpm updator

Step 5: Re-save Settings

After running the updator, visit each of the following settings pages in the admin panel and click Save to ensure all settings are properly initialized in the database:

    1Platform Settings (/admin/settings) - Security, 2FA, and integration settings
    2Blog Settings (/admin/blog/settings) - Blog status and layout settings
    3Trading Settings (/admin/trading/settings) - Spot trading settings
    4Binary Settings (/admin/finance/binary/settings) - Binary trading configuration

> Note: This step is required because the settings system has been migrated from environment variables to the database. Re-saving ensures all default values are properly stored.
Step 6: Test Notification Service

Visit the Notification Service dashboard to verify all channels are working correctly:

    1Notification Dashboard (/admin/system/notification) - Test all notification channels (IN_APP, EMAIL, SMS, PUSH)
    2Use the Channel Testing tab to send test notifications to each channel
    3Verify provider status in the Settings Panel tab
