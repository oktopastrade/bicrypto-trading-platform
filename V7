new version 7 will be released in the next 3-4 days it will be completely migrated to rust and postgres
this is the dev comment :
//
working on new release in 3-4 days, we already handled all reports and issues mentioned on v6


team been working on v7 for the past few months on the side as we knew the uws nodejs is limited and it will not be able to handle the new trading ai we been working on


rust use alot less cpu and ram and provide 300% better performance and its concurrent meaning it work in parallel serving more clients so its a huge performance gain without any effects on main thread


all api backend will be exact same paths but better handling of everything and safe processing


its type safe completely as it capture errors on compile so there is no types issues as in v6


we also removed alot of redudency and made our own exchange providers handler in rust instead of cctx for better control and performance


we also added garnet support as well as redis for huge performance gain and postgreSQL as well and new migration system so it only make changes to db on commands instead of being automated


we also made db cleaner that automatically remove all bad FKs and indexes and duplications to keep db clean and performant
//

#my advise is to wait do not do any custom work or chain integration untill new version is released users who wants to pay on fiverr for custom works redesign chains integrations better to wait the code will no longer support nextjs it will be rust
